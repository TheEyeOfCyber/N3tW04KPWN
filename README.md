<p style="color:red;">This tool is intended to be a modularized set of scripts to perform network functions in Python3. I found myself having to repeatedly look up how to perform certain Python functions related to networking so I put them in one place as a reference and functional tool</p1>

Note: Tools inside of the scripts folder are stand alone scripts
<h2>Install</h2>
